Conference Cycle Visualization

Project Goal:
In computer science, publication revolves around cyclic conference deadlines
rather than rolling journal submissions. This means that CS researchers need
to keep track of a variety of conferences relevant to their lab, including when
papers for those conferences are due, when theyâ€™ll get notifications of acceptance.
The goal of this project is to provide a tool for CS researchers to visualize
and manage their upcoming conference deadlines.
