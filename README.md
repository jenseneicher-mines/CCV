Conference Cycle Visualization

**PROJECT GOAL**
In computer science, publication revolves around cyclic conference deadlines
rather than rolling journal submissions. This means that CS researchers need
to keep track of a variety of conferences relevant to their lab, including when
papers for those conferences are due, when theyâ€™ll get notifications of acceptance.
The goal of this project is to provide a tool for CS researchers to visualize
and manage their upcoming conference deadlines.

**SETUP/USAGE/HOW TO**

To load conference rings into the visualization, click the "Choose File" button and select the text file you want to import. The text file in this repository named "conference_data.txt" is an example of a file that can
be imported.

Whenever you want to add a conference to the visualization, simply click
the "Enter a Conference" button at the top-left of the view window.
Once clicked, a pop-up window will appear. Either enter a conference
title in the "Search by Title" field, a URL of a CFP/conference from 
WikiCFP, or manually enter the conference's details. You may edit the
automatically scraped data in the fields listed under "Manually
Enter Conference Details". There you may add optional notes also. When
finished, click the "Done" button at the bottom to add the conference
to the visualization on the home screen. A new ring will appear with
a distinct color.

Deleting conferences is easy; simply click a ring, identify it is the
conference you intend to delete, and click the "Delete Conference"
button that appears beneath the description box on the right side of
the home screen. Once pressed, the conference will be removed from the 
visualization as expected.
